  # Humans

  ### Homeworld
  Sol; Under the Trans-Solar Federation

  ### Temperment
  Varies massively, so much so that most aliens never know what to even try to expect.

  ### Secondary Species of Interest
  Humans tend to be so varied in outlook that they can view any of the other inteligent species in any way, the only true outlier are the Arachnids - who many humans tend to show an aversion to due to their shared origins - even still they more often live and let live.

  Depending on who you ask, humans are either unremarkable or the universal standard to which everything else is compared.
  They have no special mechanics or notable attributes.


###  Note A:
Human skin tones are unlocked entirely, this is due to a variety of reasons leading from gene modification to radiation mutation or evolution.

###  Note B:
Humans have access to the entire repitoir of anthro ears and tails, see above for why.
