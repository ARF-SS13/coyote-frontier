  # Arachnids

  ### Homeworld
  Sol; Under the Trans-Solar Federation

  ### Temperment
  The one prototypical vibe that Arachnids tend to give off is that of patience, but when missing from them it tends to be missing in full - Near Zen or Frantic ADHD.  Very rarely in the middle.

  ### Secondary Species of Interest
  Moths - Arachnids have a varied outlook on their sentient insectoid companions, often being nearly unable to view Moth Sentients as anything but - well.  Prey.  Ultimately it is rarely acted upon though, and usually to the disdain of their Arachnid kin.


  Humans - on the other hand - are viewed as a sort of 'over excited younger sibling' by many Arachnids, who notice the lack of patience in their Planetary companions.


  Diona - Are fascinating to the average Arachnid, something about the living vegetation calls to their primordial soul and they tend to be fast to try and make friends with the bushier space goers.

  They have two additional Pocket slots in their inventory. They can eat raw meat without any ill effects, but some foods like chocolate and onion poisons them.
  They suffocate 50% faster, and their Blue Blood can't be metabolised from Iron, being based on Copper instead.

  Their unarmed attacks deal Piercing damage instead of Blunt.

  Arachnids can create Websilk at the cost of getting more hungry. They (and only they) can craft bundles of websilk into various items from clothing and shields to entire walls.
