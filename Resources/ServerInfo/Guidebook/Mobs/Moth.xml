  # Moth People

  ### Homeworld
  DÃµm, in the Garden System


  ### Temperment
  Most Moth people tend to be organized, careful and focused on mercantile interactions.

  ### Secondary Species of Interest

  Vulpkanin - Many of the Moth community have a friendly rivalry with their Vulpkanin crewmates when it comes to mercantilism and general productivity.

  Rodentia - Rodentia are complicated for many in Moth society, while they find their short statures and generally mammalian forms pretty mundane or even adorable something about their rumored habits of making messes discomforts some.
