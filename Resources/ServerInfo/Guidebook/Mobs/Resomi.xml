  # Resomi

  ### Homeworld
  Sirisai

  ### Temperament
  The average Resomi appears to be a worrier, a creature tortured by it's own sentience to a degree. Panic being second nature to them and peaceful quiet being something they truly seem to want but their overactive imaginations often deny them.

  ### Secondary Species of Interest
  Rodentia - Rodentia and Resomi are two of the sectors few species that go hand in hand with one another, with Resomi happily encouraging the Rodentia tendency to horde if it means that their small friends quiet shyness can encourage a peaceful atmosphere.

  Oni - Resomi are terrified of Oni, knowing full well that they're the 'big dogs' of the sector.  The fact that Oni are terrified of them to doesn't seem to be thought too hard on, all the average Resomi knows is that most Oni's
  scream and move very fast when they see them, and that alone is terrifying.

  Sheleg - Resomi share some of a comfortable tempature range with the mighty Shelegs, and while they do get along fairly well - well. Resomi are just worrisome creatures.

  Resomi are a small avian-like species that hail from an icy world.

  While their wings do not grant them complete flight, they are able to use them to maneuver better while in zero-gravity.

  Like most other non-human species, Resomi are capable of digesting raw meat and other uncooked animal proteins.

  As a result of the conditions of their home planet and ammonia-based blood, Resomi are considerably more tolerant of the cold, able to withstand temperatures as low as -77°C.
  Consequently, they find temperatures that most other species find comfortable to be unbearably hot, finding themselves suffering starting at just 30°C.

  Along with their temperature tolerances, they also take less cold damage and more heat damage, similar to Moth People.

  Due to their small size, they can fit in duffelbags.

  Their unarmed attack deals Slash damage.
