  # Reptilians

 ### Homeworld
  Moghes in the Beta Centaurus System

  ### Temperment
  People often assume that Reptillian crew come in one of two flavors.  The Cold, calculating, near mechanically minded - or - the skittery, gun-shy and devious.

  ### Secondary Species of Interest
  Rodentia - The Reptillian peoples have a history of eating small mammals in their society, a well known fact to the Rodentia - and while they would never do such a heinous thing many do revel in the fear it can create.

  Shelegs - Many Reptillian crew distrust Shelegs, due to a belief that nothing that cold can be safe.

  Goblins - Goblins are often seen as good companions for the more devious and skittery Reptillians, who often find their frantic attitudes align well with their shorter friends.
