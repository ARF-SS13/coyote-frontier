  # Goblins

  ### Homeworld
  Unknown

  ### Temperment
  Goblins tend to lean towards the devious. They are often pranksters, and will make jokes with or about just about anyone. A few have been noted for their bent towards more scientific topics though.

  ### Secondary Species of Interest
  IPC - Goblins find themselves often underappreciated, but when it comes to IPC the two often revel in what can best be described as a deep desire to `F around and find out.`

  Dwarves - Goblins and Dwarves often find a reason to come to blows - if almost never lethal ones.  Despite this Goblins are absolutely ride or dies for any Dwarf, just like Dwarves are for them. Even if sometimes it's Ride And Die.

  Feroxi - Goblins tend to be heavily intimidated by Feroxi, even the tamest and gentlest of Feroxi have been known to make strong Goblins uneasy.  It's something to do with the teeth.
